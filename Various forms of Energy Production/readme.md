# Introduction

Data Analytics project on finding valuable insights of progess and growth of continents in various forms of energy. The findings in divided into 3 parts:

    1. Progress of Continents
    2. Progress of Asia
    3. Progress of India

# Conclusion

Some of the highlights from the insights are as follows:
- Coal has been the dominant source of energy
- Asia generated highest energy (overall) in 2010
- Asia is the leading continent in providing highest Coal energy production.
- America is the leading continent in providing highest Hydro energy production.
- Europe is the leading continent in providing highest Natural Gas energy production. Indiaâ€™s growth has increased by 4 times since 1990.
- Iran is the leading contributor of oil in Asia.
